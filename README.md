# Eigen package
You need include Eigen package for some matrix or vector calculations; http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
# Usage of the code
You can find source codes to generate variables following different stochastic distributions, which are commonly used in describing geological patterns.
normal and truncated normal
lognormal and truncated lognormal
exponential and trunctated exponential
gamma law
fisher distirbution in 2D and 3D.
# Sampling distribution
You can also find the source code of multilayer perceptron method (MLP) to make the curve fitting of frequency data. Combined the MLP method and inverse CDF method, we can generate variables following any sampling distribution.
