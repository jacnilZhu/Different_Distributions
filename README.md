# Eigen package
You need include Eigen package for some matrix or vector calculations; http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

# Usage of the code
You can find source codes to generate variables following different stochastic distribution, which include normal, truncated normal, lognormal, truncated lognormal, exponential, trunctated exponential, gamma law, fisher distirbution in 2D and 3D.

You can also find the source code of multilayer perceptron method (MLP) to make the curve fitting of frequency data. Combined the MLP method and inverse CDF method, we can generate variables following any sampling distribution.
